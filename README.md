A Machine Learning–based system to predict Income Tax Return (ITR) amounts, detect tax anomalies/outliers, and provide interactive predictions using a Streamlit web application.The project is designed using realistic Indian tax data and modern ML techniques.
my project overview:- The traditional tax compliance systems rely heavily on rule-based methods, which are rigid, slow, and unable to adapt to new fraud or anomaly patterns.
This project overcomes those limitations by using Machine Learning models to: 
Predict ITR amounts accurately Detect anomalous (suspicious) tax records Provide real-time predictions through a user-friendly web interface
